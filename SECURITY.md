Security Policy for Socket Communication Layer
This document outlines security considerations for the Socket Communication Layer project, a simple TCP-based client-server system designed for educational purposes. The project consists of cliently (a client) and socketly (a server) to send and receive debug messages over port 8080. While not intended for production use, understanding its security implications is valuable for learning and experimentation.
Supported Versions
This project is a single-version educational tool with no official releases or versioned support. The latest code in the repository reflects the current state as of February 23, 2025.

Security Considerations
Overview
The Socket Communication Layer is a minimal TCP socket implementation with the following security-relevant characteristics:

  Client (cliently): Connects to a server, sends user-input messages, and receives responses.
  Server (socketly): Listens on port 8080, accepts a single client, and echoes back received messages (current implementation) or executes them as shell commands (earlier versions).
  Network: Operates over TCP, typically on a local network, but can be exposed externally with port forwarding.

Potential Vulnerabilities

  Command Injection (Earlier Versions):
        Risk: In earlier iterations, socketly used popen to execute client-sent messages as shell commands, allowing arbitrary command execution (e.g., rm -rf / if unprotected).
        Status: Mitigated in the current echo mode by removing popen. Reintroduced only if switching back to command execution mode.
        Severity: High (if command execution is re-enabled without validation).
  Lack of Authentication:
        Risk: Any client can connect to socketly on port 8080 without credentials, potentially allowing unauthorized access or message spoofing.
        Severity: Medium (depends on network exposure).
  No Encryption:
        Risk: Messages are sent in plaintext over TCP, making them vulnerable to interception (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks) if exposed beyond a trusted LAN.
        Severity: Medium to High (if used over the internet).
  Single-Client Limitation:
        Risk: socketly handles only one connection at a time, which could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) if a malicious client holds the connection indefinitely.
        Severity: Low (educational context).
  Buffer Overflow Potential:
        Risk: While recv limits input to BUFFER_SIZE - 1 (1023 bytes), insufficient bounds checking in future modifications could overflow buffers.
        Status: Currently mitigated by proper buffer handling.
        Severity: Low (with current code).
  Signal Handling Exposure:
        Risk: The signal handler sets a global interrupted flag without additional protection, potentially exploitable in a threaded context (not currently implemented).
        Severity: Low (single-threaded design).

Mitigation Strategies

  Command Injection:
        Current: Echo mode avoids executing commands, eliminating this risk.
        If Reverting to Command Mode: 
            Validate input against a whitelist of safe commands (e.g., echo, ls).
            Use fork and exec with sanitized arguments instead of popen to avoid shell interpretation.
  Authentication:
        Add a simple handshake (e.g., client sends a predefined token on connect, server verifies it).
        Example: Send "AUTH:secret" and check on the server before proceeding.
  Encryption:
        For educational enhancement, integrate TLS using OpenSSL (e.g., libssl) to encrypt communication.
        Basic setup requires certificates and modifying socket calls (SSL_connect, SSL_accept).
  Denial-of-Service:
        Implement a timeout for client connections using setsockopt with SO_RCVTIMEO.
        Upgrade to multi-client handling with threads or select/poll to allow concurrent connections.
  Buffer Safety:
        Continue enforcing BUFFER_SIZE - 1 in recv and ensure all buffers are null-terminated.
        Use strnlen or similar for string operations to prevent overruns.
  Network Exposure:
        Restrict socketly to local networks (e.g., bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of INADDR_ANY) unless external access is intentional.
        Use firewall rules (e.g., ufw allow from xxx.xxx.x.x/xx to any port 8080) to limit access.

Reporting a Vulnerability
This project is educational and not maintained for production use, but we welcome feedback on security issues for learning purposes:

  How to Report: Contact the project author via [insert preferred contact method, e.g., email or GitHub issues]. Describe the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.
  Response Time: As an educational project, responses may be informal and depend on availability, typically within a week.

Recommendations for Safe Use

  Educational Context: Use this on a trusted local network (e.g., xxx.xxx.x.x) to avoid exposing it to untrusted clients.
  Firewall: Always keep port 8080 restricted to specific IPs unless testing externally.
  Debug Mode: Leverage --debug to monitor behavior during experiments:

    ./socketly --debug
    ./cliently dkserver --debug

  Avoid Production: Do not deploy this in a production environment without significant hardening (authentication, encryption, input validation).

Known Issues from Development

  Check iptables Rule: A past issue caused connection timeouts due to conflicting port 8080 rules.(sudo iptables -L -n --line-numbers or doas iptables -L -n --line-numbers).
  Command Errors: Early versions misinterpreted messages as shell commands (e.g., "Hello Server!" → "not found"). Fixed by using echo command.

Future Security Enhancements
For educational growth, consider:

  Adding TLS for encrypted communication.
  Implementing a basic authentication protocol.
  Supporting multiple clients with thread safety.
  Replacing popen with safer execution methods if command functionality is desired.
